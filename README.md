# Hackverse-22_Life-Expectancy-Prediction
- This repository showcases the participation in _**HACKVERSE-22**_ at Christ(Deemed to be University) Lavasa Pune.
- The first ever _24-Hourâ€™s_ Hackathon at Christ (Deemed to be University) Lavasa Pune, where we were given life expectancy data; where we had to develop a model using ML and optimization techniques which can predict the life span of a person that some factors of his age and also showcase as a deployment where it can be responsive to the server and graphs can be present for better analysis. <br>
Our team name was _"Brewing Java"_, and we reached the last round of the hackathon as a team. <br>
